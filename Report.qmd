# *The Protagonist*

The role of **Loki** is played by **Tom Hiddleston**.

The Asgardian god of mischief and Thor's adopted brother, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. This is an alternate, "time-variant" version of Loki who created a new timeline in *Avengers: Endgame (2019)* beginning in 2012. Because of this, he has not gone through the events of *Thor: The Dark World (2013)* or *Thor: Ragnarok (2017)*, which reformed the previously villainous character before his death in *Avengers: Infinity War (2018).*

The image below present a picture of the protagonist and the the character he played.
