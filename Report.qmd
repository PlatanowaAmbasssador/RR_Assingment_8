# Summary and Review

Generally, it is very much recomended to watch Loki (TV Series). Though, some episodes may disappoint but otherwise it is one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series.Find out the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW948Va-l10).

Furthermore, you may find one of IMDB's reviewers review useful:

::: {.callout-tip}
I held off on this until the final episode. The series started brilliantly, and they packed an enormous amount into each episode - but as it became more complicated I became a little apprehensive about how it would all finish up - I shouldn't have been, they smashed it out of the park.

Episode 6 is one of the best episodes of TV I've ever watched - but that sounds redundant, because the standard is so high all round that it's top shelf movie quality production all the way.

Every aspect of production is so finely attuned that this was a joy to watch.

Having said that, it sounds like it was a show not a story, but make no mistake, this is a very self assured piece of story telling controlled with real finesse.

Loki season 2 is a comfortable 9.5 in my book - a really well crafted epic journey.
